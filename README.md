# EATRIS-Plus ISA metadata structure

The [Jupyter notebook](notebooks/create_isa_files.ipynb) creates ISA metadata files following the metadata structure of the [EATRIS-Plus demonstrator project](https://eatris.eu/projects/eatris-plus/). ISA-Tab and ISA-JSON output files are created in the `ISA` directory.

A conda environment to run this notebook can be created as described in https://github.com/Xomics/Isatools_environment.
